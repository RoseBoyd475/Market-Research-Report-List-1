<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocephalus Shunt Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Pressure</li><li>Monopressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrocephalus shunt valves market is primarily categorized into adjustable pressure and monopressure types. Adjustable pressure valves allow for customization of intracranial pressure settings, enabling healthcare providers to modify pressure levels as needed for optimal patient care. In contrast, monopressure valves maintain a fixed pressure, providing consistent drainage but without the flexibility for adjustments. Both types are critical for managing hydrocephalus, addressing the unique needs of patients and their specific condition management requirements.</p></p>
