<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship exhaust gas scrubber market comprises three main types: open loop scrubbers, closed loop scrubbers, and hybrid scrubbers. Open loop scrubbers utilize seawater to neutralize sulfur oxides, discharging treated water back into the ocean. Closed loop scrubbers, on the other hand, use a recirculating water system with chemicals to clean exhaust gases and produce less discharge. Hybrid scrubbers offer versatility, allowing operators to switch between open and closed loop modes based on regulatory requirements and operational conditions.</p></p>
