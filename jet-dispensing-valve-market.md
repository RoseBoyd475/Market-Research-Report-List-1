<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jet Dispensing Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Jet Valves</li><li>Non-contact Jet Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The jet dispensing valve market is divided into two main types: contact jet valves and non-contact jet valves. Contact jet valves operate by directing a fluid stream directly onto the substrate, ensuring precise placement and minimal waste, often used in high-speed applications. In contrast, non-contact jet valves create a controlled stream of fluid that propels droplets to the target surface without physical contact, making them ideal for sensitive materials and delicate substrates. Both types enhance efficiency in various industrial and manufacturing processes.</p></p>
